- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @Deadicate also known as Moore Codes. I became hooked on software late in life, and now learn constantly to improve my software developer skills.
- ðŸ‘€ I work as a mostly back-end C developer for Dematic Software, creating software to automate warehouse operations. We utilise Git/GitLab to maintain our codebase, use a Matflo C system to write code, utilising Ember.JS for user interface, utilising test-driven development to write code and to detect any bugs early.
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m looking for a mid-level role in softwarte engineering using React frameworks to build large web apps.
- ðŸ“« How to reach me: email @ ianm12310@gmail.com  or add me on LinkedIn with https://www.linkedin.com/in/imoore1234
